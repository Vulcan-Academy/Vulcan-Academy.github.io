# Vulcanomicon

The Vulcan Academy's operating system.

1. The goal of the game is to create a learning organization.
1. All players must unanimously agree to all rule changes.
1. Proposals may add, amend or repeal a rule.
1. All rules should be logically self-consistent. 

## Reality
1. Our understanding of __Reality__ is throttled by our ability to percieve it. 
    * We use logic to describe our understanding of __Reality__.
1. __Reality__ is exclusively inhabited by __Information__, and patterns thereof.
    * __Information__ contained within __Empirical Reality__ inhabits 3 spatial dimensions and 1 monotonically increasing temporal dimension.
1. __Information__ may interact with and modify other __Information__. This is an __Action__.

## Lexicon

* __Reality__: The set of everything that exists or does not exist.
* __Information__: What is conveyed by a particuar arrangement of things.
* __Empirical Reality__: __Reality__ that is verifiable by observation rather than theory or pure logic.
* __Action__: An interaction between __Information__.
* __Pattern__: A distinguishable set of __Information__.
* __Decision Function__: Given __Reality__ _R_ and __Actions__ _A_ = { _a_<sub>0</sub>, ... }, we define __Decision Function__ _d_ such that _d_(_R_) = { _a_<sub>k</sub>, ... }.
* __Agent__: A __Pattern__ that has the ability to perform __Actions__. __Agents__ choose which __Action__ to perform based on a __Decision Function__.
    * An __Agent__ inhabiting __Empirical Reality__ evaluates its __Decision Function__ at every infintesimally small time-dimension increment.
* __Rational Agent__: an __Agent__ who's __Decision Function__ operates according to beliefs.
